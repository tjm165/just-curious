This one was pretty easy. You should know that the username is admin and then just brute force passwords. To get fancy I wrote a go script which pulls from a list of commonly used passwords.

The bummer is taht I think they want you to guess the username as well by using a list of common usernames. That felt lame to me but who am I to talk.
